Introduct of Tree
recursiver datastructures
root
children
parent
sibling -  has same parent
leaf    - no children
cousin  
if we can go from A to B
A is ancestor of B
B is de scedent of A 

subtree
left subtree
right subtree

Depth and Height
Depth of x :
length of the path from root to x
No. of edges in path from root to x
Height of x :
No. of edges in longest of path from x to a leaf
Height of leaf = 0
Height of root node = Height
Height of tree = Height of root node
 
Binary tree
a tree in which node can have at most 2 children
Application
1)store naturally
    hierarchical data -> eg:file system
2)organize data
    for quick search ,insertion,deletion
                    -> Binary search tree
3)trie->dirctionary
4)network routing algorithm
