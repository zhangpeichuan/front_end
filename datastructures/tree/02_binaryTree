strict/Proper Binary tree
    each node can have either 2 or 0 children
Complete Binary Tree
    All levels expect possibly the last are 
    completely filled and all nodes are as 
    left as possible
max No. of nodes at level i = 2i
Perfect Binary Tree
Max nodes
= 20+21+...+2h = 2H+1 -1 = 2(no.  of level) - 1
h is Height of tree
n =  (2H+1)-1 =no. of nodes 
n+1 = 2H+1 
n = log2(h+1)-1
height of Perfect Binary tree with n nodes
h = log2(n+1) - 1
height of completely Binary tree with n nodes
n = [log2(n)]

blance Binary tree
implement Binary tree
a) dynamically create nodes
b) arrays
for node at index i
left child inode is 2*i+1;
right children inode is 2*i+2
in Complete Binary tree
